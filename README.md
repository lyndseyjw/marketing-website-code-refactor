Making a Marketing Website more Accessible

It is best coding practice to develop websites that are accessible to all viewers (& any other developers that will see the code at a later time). The style should be concise & sequential, with adequate comments so that it can always be built upon & improved, by anyone approaching the project. Accessible code ensures success for a company as it limits potentials for error & increases the number of clients by improving search engine optimization.
In order to enhance the code for this marketing company, I re-labeled elements within HTML to adhere to a sequential & descriptive semantic style. This will improve the company's chances that clients will find their site from a web search. I also added 'alt' attributes to all images so that users with visual impairments can still access the site & will not have a lower quality experience. I also gave more space between each of the elements to allow for quick & easy viewing among multiple team members - it can be challenging to find elements when they are super close to one another.
In CSS, I combined multiple elements with the same properties & rearranged them so they were in sequential order based on web layout. This will help simplify the code & again allow for quick editing access. I added concise comments on each of the sections for quick access - this will allow developers to quickly connect element names to web content so they do not have to flip back & forth between HTML & CSS.
